This is the code for the "An intro to probabilistic programming with Uber's Pyro" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday, November 16 at 12 PM PST

Create a Bayesian regression model using Uber's Pyro. You can use any dataset you'd like or a toy dataset. You can find samples of this [here](http://pyro.ai/examples/bayesian_regression.html). Bonus points for good documentation. Good luck! 

## Overview

This is the demo code from [this](https://youtu.be/ATaMq62fXno) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on Probabilistic programming using Uber's Pyro. http://pyro.ai/

## Dependencies

* pytorch
* numpy

install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) 

## Usage

run `demo.py` in terminal to see the output

## Credits

Credits go to the Uber team, i've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
